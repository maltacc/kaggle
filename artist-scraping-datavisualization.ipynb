says\\nYou're my best friend\\nAnd you knew what it was\\nHe is in love\\n\\nYou can hear it in the silence, silence\\nYou can feel it on the way home, way home\\nYou can see it with the lights out, lights out\\nYou are in love, true love\\n\\nAnd so it goes\\nYou two are dancing in a snowglobe round and round\\nAnd he keeps the picture of you in his office downtown\\nAnd you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars\\nAnd why I've spent my whole life trying to put it in words\\n\\nCause you can hear in the silence\\nYou can feel it on the way home\\nYou can see it with
